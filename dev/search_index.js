Each option can have a short flag (single character) and a long name, separated by a comma or space or vertical bar ('|').\n\nThe options can be accessed as properties on the Command object. Multi-word options such as \"--template-engine\" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc. See also optional new behaviour to [avoid name clashes](#avoiding-option-name-clashes).\n\nMultiple short flags may optionally be combined in a single argument following the dash: boolean flags, the last flag may take a value, and the value.\nFor example `-a -b -p 80` may be written as `-ab -p80` or even `-abp80`.\n\nYou can use `--` to indicate the end of the options, and any remaining arguments will be used without being interpreted.\nThis is particularly useful for passing options through to another\ncommand, like: `do -- git --version`.\n\nOptions on the command line are not positional, and can be specified before or after other command arguments.\n\n### Common option types, boolean and value\n\nThe two most used option types are a boolean flag, and an option which takes a value (declared using angle brackets). Both are `undefined` unless specified on command line.\n","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"js const { program } = require('commander');","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"program   .option('-d, –debug', 'output extra debugging')   .option('-s, –small', 'small pizza size')   .option('-p, –pizza-type <type>', 'flavour of pizza');","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"program.parse(process.argv);","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"if (program.debug) console.log(program.opts()); console.log('pizza details:'); if (program.small) console.log('- small pizza size'); if (program.pizzaType) console.log(- ${program.pizzaType});","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"bash $ pizza-options -d { debug: true, small: undefined, pizzaType: undefined } pizza details: $ pizza-options -p error: option '-p, –pizza-type <type>' argument missing $ pizza-options -ds -p vegetarian { debug: true, small: true, pizzaType: 'vegetarian' } pizza details:","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"small pizza size\nvegetarian","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"$ pizza-options –pizza-type=cheese pizza details:","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"cheese","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"\n`program.parse(arguments)` processes the arguments, leaving any args not consumed by the program options in the `program.args` array.\n\n### Default option value\n\nYou can specify a default value for an option which takes a value.\n","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"js const { program } = require('commander');","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"program   .option('-c, –cheese <type>', 'add the specified type of cheese', 'blue');","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"program.parse(process.argv);","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"console.log(cheese: ${program.cheese});","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"bash $ pizza-options cheese: blue $ pizza-options –cheese stilton cheese: stilton","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/commander/Readme/","page":"Commander.js","title":"Commander.js","text":"\n### Other option types, negatable boolean and flag|value\n\nYou can specify a boolean option long name with a leading `no-` to set the option value to false when used.\nDefined alone this also makes the option true by default.\n\nIf you define `--foo` first, adding `--no-foo` does not change the default value from what it would\notherwise be.

You can override\nthis behaviour and optionally supply a callback. The default override throws a `CommanderError`.\n\nThe override callback is passed a `CommanderError` with properties `exitCode` number, `code` string, and `message`. The default override behaviour is to throw the error, except for async handling of executable subcommand completion which carries on.

Here are a few tips:","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/prismjs/README/","page":"Prism","title":"Prism","text":"Read the documentation. Prism was designed to be extensible.\nDo not edit prism.js, it’s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the components/ folder. prism.js and all minified files are also generated automatically by our build system.\nThe build system uses gulp to minify the files and build prism.js. With all of Prism's dependencies installed, you just need to run the command npm run build.\nPlease follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.\nPlease try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than a few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes that I want to merge and also changes that I don't, handling it becomes difficult.\nMy time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review bigger PRs (small ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn't mean your PR is rejected.\nIf you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.\nIf you add a new language definition or plugin, you need to add it to components.json as well and rebuild Prism by running npm run build, so that it becomes available to the download build page. For new languages, please also add a few tests and an example in the examples/ folder.\nGo to prism-themes if you want to add a new theme.","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/prismjs/README/","page":"Prism","title":"Prism","text":"Thank you so much for contributing!!","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/prismjs/README/#Translations","page":"Prism","title":"Translations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"node_modules/prismjs/README/","page":"Prism","title":"Prism","text":"简体中文 (temporarily unavailable; see copy here)","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/#Release-history","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"<details>   <summary><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></summary>","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"Changelogs are for humans, not machines.\nThere should be an entry for every single version.\nThe same types of changes should be grouped.\nVersions and sections should be linkable.\nThe latest version comes first.\nThe release date of each versions is displayed.\nMention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"</details>","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"<details>   <summary><strong>Types of changes</strong></summary>","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"Changelog entries are classified using the following labels (from keep-a-changelog):","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"Added for new features.\nChanged for changes in existing functionality.\nDeprecated for soon-to-be removed features.\nRemoved for now removed features.\nFixed for any bug fixes.\nSecurity in case of vulnerabilities.","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"</details>","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/#[3.0.0]-2018-04-08","page":"Release history","title":"[3.0.0] - 2018-04-08","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"node_modules/braces/CHANGELOG/","page":"Release history","title":"Release history","text":"v3.0 is a complete refactor, resulting in a faster, smaller codebase, with fewer deps, and a more accurate parser and compiler.

Picomatch would return false for both foo and foobar.","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"<br>","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/#Advanced-globbing","page":"-","title":"Advanced globbing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"extglobs\nPOSIX brackets\nBraces","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/#Extglobs","page":"-","title":"Extglobs","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"Pattern Description\n@(pattern) Match only one consecutive occurrence of pattern\n*(pattern) Match zero or more consecutive occurrences of pattern\n+(pattern) Match one or more consecutive occurrences of pattern\n?(pattern) Match zero or one consecutive occurrences of pattern\n!(pattern) Match anything but pattern","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"Examples","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"const pm = require('picomatch');\n\n// *(pattern) matches ZERO or more of \"pattern\"\nconsole.log(pm.isMatch('a', 'a*(z)')); // true\nconsole.log(pm.isMatch('az', 'a*(z)')); // true\nconsole.log(pm.isMatch('azzz', 'a*(z)')); // true\n\n// +(pattern) matches ONE or more of \"pattern\"\nconsole.log(pm.isMatch('a', 'a*(z)')); // true\nconsole.log(pm.isMatch('az', 'a*(z)')); // true\nconsole.log(pm.isMatch('azzz', 'a*(z)')); // true\n\n// supports multiple extglobs\nconsole.log(pm.isMatch('foo.bar', '!(foo).!(bar)')); // false\n\n// supports nested extglobs\nconsole.log(pm.isMatch('foo.bar', '!(!(foo)).!(!(bar))')); // true","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/#POSIX-brackets","page":"-","title":"POSIX brackets","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"node_modules/picomatch/README/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"POSIX classes are disabled by default.

For example, a?b would match the path /xyz/123/acb, but not /xyz/acb/123.\nbash boolean false Follow bash matching rules more strictly - disallows backslashes as escape characters, and treats single stars as globstars (**).\ncapture boolean undefined Return regex matches in supporting methods.\ncontains boolean undefined Allows glob to match any part of the given string(s).\ncwd string process.cwd() Current working directory. Used by picomatch.split()\ndebug boolean undefined Debug regular expressions when an error is thrown.\ndot boolean false Match dotfiles. Otherwise dotfiles are ignored unless a . is explicitly defined in the pattern.\nexpandRange function undefined Custom function for expanding ranges in brace patterns, such as {a..z}. The function receives the range values as two arguments, and it must return a string to be used in the generated regex. It's recommended that returned strings be wrapped in parentheses. This option is overridden by the expandBrace option.\nfailglob boolean false Similar to the failglob behavior in Bash, throws an error when no matches are found. Based on the bash option of the same name.\nfastpaths boolean true To speed up processing, full parsing is skipped for a handful common glob patterns. Disable this behavior by setting this option to false.\nflags boolean undefined Regex flags to use in the generated regex. If defined, the nocase option will be overridden.\nformat function undefined Custom function for formatting the returned string. This is useful for removing leading slashes, converting Windows paths to Posix paths, etc.\nignore array|string undefined One or more glob patterns for excluding strings that should not be matched from the result.\nkeepQuotes boolean false Retain quotes in the generated regex, since quotes may also be used as an alternative to backslashes.\nliteralBrackets boolean undefined When true, brackets in the glob pattern will be escaped so that only literal brackets will be matched.\nlookbehinds boolean true Support regex positive and negative lookbehinds. Note that you must be using Node 8.1.10 or higher to enable regex lookbehinds.\nmatchBase boolean false Alias for basename\nmaxLength boolean 65536 Limit the max length of the input string. An error is thrown if the input string is longer than this value.\nnobrace boolean false Disable brace matching, so that {a,b} and {1..3} would be treated as literal characters.\nnobracket boolean undefined Disable matching with regex brackets.\nnocase boolean false Perform case-insensitive matching. Equivalent to the regex i flag. Note that this option is ignored when the flags option is defined.\nnodupes boolean true Deprecated, use nounique instead. This option will be removed in a future major release. By default duplicates are removed. Disable uniquification by setting this option to false.\nnoext boolean false Alias for noextglob\nnoextglob boolean false Disable support for matching with extglobs (like +(a|b))\nnoglobstar boolean false Disable support for matching nested directories with globstars (**)\nnonegate boolean false Disable support for negating with leading !\nnoquantifiers boolean false Disable support for regex quantifiers (like a{1,2}) and treat them as brace patterns to be expanded.\nonIgnore function undefined Function to be called on ignored items.\nonMatch function undefined Function to be called on matched items.\nonResult function undefined Function to be called on all items, regardless of whether or not they are matched or ignored.\nposix boolean false Support POSIX character classes (\"posix brackets\").\nposixSlashes boolean undefined Convert all slashes in file paths to forward slashes. This does not convert slashes in the glob pattern itself\nprepend string undefined String to prepend to the generated regex used for matching.\nregex boolean false Use regular expression rules for + (instead of matching literal +), and for stars that follow closing parentheses or brackets (as in )* and ]*).\nstrictBrackets boolean undefined Throw an error if brackets, braces, or parens are imbalanced.\nstrictSlashes boolean undefined When true, picomatch won't match trailing slashes with single stars.\nunescape boolean undefined Remove preceding backslashes from escaped glob characters before creating the regular expression to perform matches.\nunixify boolean undefined Alias for posixSlashes, for backwards compatitibility.","category":"page"},{"location":"node_modules/micromatch/README/#Options-Examples","page":"micromatch (Image: NPM version) (Image: NPM monthly downloads) (Image: NPM total downloads) (Image: Linux Build Status)","title":"Options Examples","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"node_modules/micromatch/README/#options.basename","page":"micromatch (Image: NPM version) (Image: NPM monthly downloads) (Image: NPM total downloads) (Image: Linux Build Status)","title":"options.basename","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"node_modules/micromatch/README/","page":"micromatch (Image: NPM version) (Image: NPM monthly downloads) (Image: NPM total downloads) (Image: Linux Build Status)","title":"micromatch (Image: NPM version) (Image: NPM monthly downloads) (Image: NPM total downloads) (Image: Linux Build Status)","text":"Allow glob patterns without slashes to match a file path based on its basename.
